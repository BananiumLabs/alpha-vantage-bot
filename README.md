# AlphaVantage Bot

Collects data on intraday statistics and stores locally.

Developed by [Ben Cuan](https://github.com/dbqeo) and [Alexey Kolechkin](https://github.com/kuxxe)

## Running locally

You need your own AlphaVantage API key to use this bot! Create a file `key.txt` containing only your key in the root directory.

Data is saved in folders named after the date, i.e. `yyyy-mm-dd` within the parent folder `src/data`.
